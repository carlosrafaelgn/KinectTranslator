KinectTranslator
================

During Scratch Conference 2012 (Scratch@MIT 2012 | Create Your World), held at MIT in July, I was introduced to an amazing tool which allows Scratch to connect to the Microsoft Kinect Sensor Bar, called Kinect 2 Scratch (http://scratch.saorog.com and http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/kinect/Kinect-2-Scratch).

Even though it is such an amazing tool, it was not possible to find some of the features I truly wanted:

- Capability to select the values sent to Scratch, considerably shrinking the displayed list of sensors;
- A light-weight UI, making it easier for low-end computers to run the software;
- Being able to translate the UI into other languages without having to recompile the software.

Kinect Translator has been created with all that in mind. The software has no main window, as it runs in the background, being controlled by its menu commands, accessed through the icon at the system tray.

The default UI language is English, but once a configuration file is created, along with a Unicode translation file, it is possible to change the language (the committed configuration file sets the language to Portuguese).
